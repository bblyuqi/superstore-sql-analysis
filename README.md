## 🔍 Analysis & Queries
Queries are organized in the caseportfolio.sql
- `sales_vs_profit_by_region.sql` → Sales & profit analysis by region.
- `monthly_profit_trend.sql` → Monthly profit trends (2014–2018).
- `loss_months_breakdown.sql` → Identifying months with negative profit and category breakdown.
- `shipping_delay_by_category.sql` → Shipping delays by category over time.
- `shipping_delay_by_mode.sql` → Shipping delays by shipping mode.
- `top_customers.sql` → Top customers analysis.
- `top_products.sql` → Top profit-contributing products.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **West region** has the highest sales & profit despite large discounts.
- **Central region** has low profit despite high discounts (discount ≠ profitability).
- **Standard Class** shipping shows the most delays, especially in Office Supplies.
- **Copiers (Canon imageCLASS)** dominates profit in its sub-category.

---

## 🗝 Key Takeaways
- **Big discounts can be a trap** for profitability.
- **Operational insights** (e.g., shipping delays) can guide process improvements.
- **Data storytelling** is crucial to make analysis actionable.
